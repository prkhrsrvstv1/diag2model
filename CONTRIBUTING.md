# Contributing Guideline

We ove your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and 
transparent as possible, whether it's:
* Reporting a bug
* Discussing current state of the project
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing a new feature
* etc


## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.  
We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), so all 
code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to 
propose changes to the codebase.


## How To Contribute

* Fork the repository and create your branch from **main**
* Check out open issues or open your own issue
* In the case of implementing neural network:
    * Use its diagram to have a helicopter view 
    * Read its paper for more details e.g. number of filters
* Check out model summary to make sure whether it is implemented correctly or not
* Submit your pull request  
**If you are beginner in contributing to open source, use [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@d.kang/git-workflow-for-projects-cheat-sheet-35c3e51fb07c)**  


## Reporting the Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs, report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/EverLookNeverSee/diag2model/issues/new)  
Great bug report tend to have:
* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce:
  * Be specific
  * Give sample code if you can
* What you expected would happen
* what actually happens


## Coding Style

We use Python PEP-8 style guide, for more details please review [this link](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)


## License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) that covers
